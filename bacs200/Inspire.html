    <img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2019/10/14/62d02fd3-6290-4155-91ac-0c1b3b4c5057/thumbnail/300x300/9cabea4b22fda66ec550fbc445d32ad0/400553.png">
   
    <p>
   My hero is Lebron James who is a 3 time champion and has overcame many struggles with being down in games and in the finals. </p>
    <p>
    My hero is Lebron James. Throughout his NBA career, Lebron had:</p>
<ul>
    <li>12,481 FG's</li>
    <li>34,241 points</li>
    <li>3 Finals</li>
    <li>4 MVP awards</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lebron i would have to say is one of the most athletic athletes out of all sports because of his size and speed. </p>
